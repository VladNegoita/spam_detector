# Spam_detector - C language

## Step I: Presenting the structures


	For this program, there were used used two structures: email and keywords.


	###### Firstly, the email structure has the following members:

		-keywords -> a list with the number of occurences of each suspicious
					 word in the provided and added files;

		-body -> the length of a body;

		-caps -> the number of caps letters in the mail;

		-letters -> the number of letters in the mail;

		-invalid_words -> used for counting the occurences of weird
						  combinations of characters such as:

						  	-uppercase letter after lowercase letter;

						  	-three identical letters in a row;

						  	-5 consonants in a row -> cannot be pronounced;

						  	- links (http identifier);

		-from -> a string with the sender and his address;


	###### Secondly, the keywords structure is very simillar to a dictionary:

		-words -> a list of strings;

		-number -> the number of the provided keywords;

		-total -> the total number of the identifiable spam-related words.


## Step II: The criteria used


	1. uppercase -> accords a spam_score based on the percentage of caps
					letters

	2. spammers -> accords a spam_score based on an already known list
				   of spammers

	3. keywords -> calculate a specific spam_score based on the dictionary

	4. body_length -> using basic statistics (2 * sigma range around the mean)
					  will contain around 95% of the emails. The rest are the
					  ones with very long or very short body.

				   -> accords some spam_points for the unusual bodies

	5. invalid_words -> calculate a proportional score using the number of
						invalid words and the body-length and body-average
